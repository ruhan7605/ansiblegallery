Objectives 
===========
•Describe Ansible inventory concepts and manage a static inventory file.
• Describe where Ansible configuration files are located, how Ansible selects them, and edit them to apply changes to default settings.
• Run a single Ansible automation task using an ad hoc command and explain some use cases for ad hoc commands.

===============
Inventory File:
===============
• A static host inventory can be defined by a text file.


Pattern1:
    list of host names or IP addresses of managed hosts, each on a single line:

        web1.example.com
        web2.example.com
        db1.example.com
        db2.example.com
        192.0.2.42

Pattern2:
    you organize managed hosts into host groups:

        host group name enclosed in square brackets ([])
        
        [webservers]
        web1.example.com
        web2.example.com
        192.0.2.42

        [db-servers]
        db1.example.com
        db2.example.com

Pattern3:
    Hosts can be in multiple groups:

        [webservers]
        web1.example.com
        web2.example.com
        192.0.2.42

        [db-servers]
        db1.example.com
        db2.example.com
        
        [east-datacenter]
        web1.example.com
        db1.example.com
        
        [west-datacenter]
        web2.example.com
        db2.example.com
        
        [production]
        web1.example.com
        web2.example.com
        db1.example.com
        db2.example.com
        
        [development]
        192.0.2.42

Pattern4:
    Defining Nested Groups: 
    • Ansible host inventories can include groups of host groups.
    • Creating a host group name with the :children suffix

        [usa]
        washington1.example.com
        washington2.example.com

        [canada]
        ontario01.example.com
        ontario02.example.com
        
        [north-america:children]
        canada
        usa
    
Pattern5:
    Simplifying Host Specifications with Ranges:
    You can specify ranges in the host names or IP addresses to simplify Ansible host inventories. You can specify either numeric or alphabetic ranges. 
    
    Ranges have the following syntax: [start:end]

    • 192.168.[4:7].[0:255] matches all IPv4 addresses in the 192.168.4.0/22 network (192.168.4.0
    through 192.168.7.255)
    • server[01:20].example.com matches all hosts named server01.example.com through
    server20.example.com.
    • [a:c].dns.example.com matches hosts named a.dns.example.com, b.dns.example.com, and
    c.dns.example.com.
    • 2001:db8::[a:f] matches all IPv6 addresses from 2001:db8::a through 2001:db8::f.

    the [usa] and [canada] group definitions from the earlier example:
    
        [usa]
        washington[1:2].example.com
        
        [canada]
        ontario[01:02].example.com
                                                                        =====continuation====next_chapter2.1
